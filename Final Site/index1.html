                    <p class="text-muted">The genocide was conceived by extremist elements of Rwanda's majority Hutu population who planned to kill the minority Tutsi population and anyone who opposed those genocidal intentions. It is estimated that some 200,000 Hutu, spurred on by propaganda from various media outlets, participated in the genocide.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">The Rwandan genocide, also known as the genocide against the Tutsi, occurred between 7 April and 15 July 1994 during the Rwandan Civil War. During this period of around 100 days, members of the Tutsi minority ethnic group, as well as some moderate Hutu and Twa, were killed by armed militias</p>

                    <p class="text-muted"> The Rwandan Genocide took place in Rwanda, officially known as the Republic of Rwanda which is a landlocked country in the Great Rift Valley of Central Africa, where the African Great Lakes region and Southeast Africa converge. Located a few degrees south of the Equator, Rwanda is bordered by Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>

                    <h4 class="service-heading">When</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        Beginning April 7, 1994 and lasting only 100 days ending July 15, 1994, the Rwandan Genocide is one of the most notorious modern genocides. During this 100 day period between April and July 1994, nearly one million ethnic Tutsi and moderate Hutu were killed as the international community and UN peacekeepers stood by.

                    <h4 class="service-heading">Why</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted"> Due to external countries having infuence on Rwanda the Hutu-Tutsi strife stemed from class warfare, with the Tutsis perceived to have greater wealth and social status. The Hutus starting building hatred over the Tutsi, as time went on their hatred deepened, finally on April 6, 1994, when a plane carrying Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu, was shot down. Under the cover of war, Hutu extremists launched their plans to destroy the entire Tutsi civilian population.</p>

In a chapter on Wahuma (Rwanda), Speke presents what he calls his "theory of conquest of inferior by superior races," the first of many races to describe the cattle-pastoralist Tutsi as a "superior race" to their partners the hunter-gatherer Twa and agriculturalist Hutu. Shortly after that Germany colonizes Rwanda, and with Burundi and Tanzania, it becomes part of German East Africa. The Germans ruled Rwanda indirectly through Tutsi monarchs and they’re chiefs. In the year of 1933 the Belgians assume control of Rwanda, and continue to rule through the Tutsi monarchy. The Belgians then organized a census and mandate that everyone is issued an identity card classifying them as either Tutsi (approximately 14% of the population), Hutu (85%), or Twa (1%), based on the "ethnicity" of their fathers.

                                    <p class="text-muted">Tutsi refugees in Uganda - supported by some moderate Hutus - were forming the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), led by Mr Kagame. Their aim was to overthrow Habyarimana (the rwandan president at the time) and secure their right to return to their homeland. Habyarimana chose to exploit this threat as a way to bring dissident Hutus back to his side, and in the August 1993, after several attacks and months of negotiation, a peace accord was signed between Habyarimana and the RPF, but it did little to stop the continued unrest.
                                        When Habyarimana's plane was shot down at the beginning of April 1994, it was the final nail in the coffin. Exactly who killed the president - and with him the president of Burundi and many chief members of staff - has not been established. But whoever did it had started something irreparable.

                                    <p class="text-muted">The genocide was conceived by extremist elements of Rwanda’s majority Hutu population who planned to kill the minority Tutsi population and anyone who opposed those genocidal intentions. It is estimated that some 200,000 Hutu, spurred on by propaganda from various media outlets, participated in the genocide. More than 800,000 civilians—primarily Tutsi, but also moderate Hutu—were killed during the campaign, over 80% of girls over 17 were raped, and in some cases spouses even killed each other due to one of them being a Tutsi. As many as 2,000,000 Rwandans fled the country during or immediately after the genocide, which just shows how horrible this event was.

Large numbers live in dire poverty. Many have developed long-term psychological problems as a result of their trauma. But survivors have also shown enormous strength by creating groups to help each other, preserving important sites as memorials, and rebuilding their lives—at times alongside the very people who perpetrated the genocide.

                            <p>   Countless thousands of children were slaughtered during the Rwandan genocide. Proof of the carnage was everywhere throughout the country in the months after the killing. On a path winding up a hillside in Nyakizu in Butare province, a small red sweater lay discarded. Inside was the ribcage of an infant. When children went back to school at Kaduha in Gikongoro province, the bones of other children still lay strewn about the schoolyard in which they played. Of the bodies exhumed by Physicians for Human Rights at a mass grave in Kibuye province, some 44 percent were of children under the age of fifteen and 31 percent were under ten. Most had been killed by machete; fewer than 1 percent, the more fortunate, had been killed by gunfire. Among the victims treated by physicians in western Rwanda, some 30 percent were children and most had been injured by machete.
                                Over time, the bones have disappeared but many living children throughout Rwanda bear evidence of the genocide in amputated limbs and scars from machete wounds, especially across the face, head, and neck. They and all of the others, even those with no mark on their bodies, bear invisible but nonetheless real scars from having experienced horrors beyond anything imaginable. According to a survey of three thousand children done by UNICEF, 80 percent of children interviewed experienced a death in the family during the period of the genocide; 70 percent witnessed a killing or an injury; 35 percent saw other children killing or injuring other children; 88 percent saw dead bodies or body parts; 31 percent witnessed rape or sexual assault; 80 percent had to hide for protection; 61 percent were threatened that they would be killed; and 90 percent believed that they would die</p>

                            <p>   Mental health in Rwanda has been deeply impacted by the 1994 Rwandan Genocide, in which approximately one million people were killed, 250 000 women were raped, and millions of Rwandans were displaced. Survivors were exposed to extreme levels of physical and psychological violence . Studies have reported that 94% of people in Rwanda during the genocide experienced at least one genocide event including witnessing the murder of family members, having their property and homes destroyed, and having their lives threatened. As a result of these experiences, traumatic stress symptoms related to the genocide are highly prevalent. Approximately 25% of the population is estimated to meet criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder.
                                Over the last 10 years, the Rwandan government has invested heavily in delivery of quality health care, and physical health indicators have improved dramatically. However, like most low-income countries, Rwanda had almost no mental health treatment services prior to, or following, the genocide. The availability of mental health services is still very limited due in part to a lack of trained professionals and a small budget for mental health services.</p>

                            <p>As a nation Rwanda could have used the Genocide as an excuse to why they're country is suffering problems, instead, they used it as a reason to grow and prosper. As of 2018, the African country Rwanda ranks in the top five countries for gender equality according to the Global Gender Gap Report. The idea of fairness that dominates this country arose after the genocide against the Tutsi that occurred in 1994. The government is committed to ensuring equal rights for women and men without prejudice against the principles of gender equality and complementarity in national development.[3] These ideas are exhibited through the roles of Rwanda women in government, the respect for women's education and the role of women in Rwanda's healthcare. The country also took an active stance against rape in genocide, created a national action plan after United Nations Resolution 1325, and is pushing towards ending gender-based violence. As the new government seeks to move ahead, it has initiated some outstanding practices. It is against the law in Rwanda to label people by race, ethnicity, or tribe, or to organize people along those lines. Young people in school are taught to identify as “Rwandans.”  The post-genocidal government has made other dramatic changes as well. Motorcycle taxis, the main mode of transportation in the country, are required to be registered, and drivers and customers are required to wear helmets. Anticorruption billboards adorn the streets. It is against the law to discriminate based on sexual orientation.  Strict ecology laws are in place to protect natural resources, especially the rainforests.  Ecology is important. Plastic bags are against the law, and streets are almost free of litter. The Twa tribe has been resettled in new villages near their traditional hunting/gathering villages in the rainforests. The government is helping them establish other sustainable economies in the new villages. </p>
